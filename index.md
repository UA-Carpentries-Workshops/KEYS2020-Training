SYLLABUS

Show what topics will be covered.

1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
intend to teach.
4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
'tools/check' as well.

Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
